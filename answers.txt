What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Integrating changes from one branch into another branch in a Git repository can be done using either merging or rebasing. 

Making a new "merge commit" that integrates the modifications from the two branches is the process of merging. 
Git generates a new commit when you merge a branch into another branch that includes two parent commits: one from the original branch and one from the new branch. 
By doing this, a new branch is created that contains every change made to both branches.

On the other hand, rebasing entails transferring the entire branch to a new base commit. Git produces a new branch when you rebase a branch upon another branch.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a version control repository that is hosted on a remote server or platform, typically on the internet, rather than on a local machine. Remote repositories enable collaboration between multiple users working on the same codebase, as changes can be shared and merged across different machines and locations.
